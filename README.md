My experience learning to use Ai Agents without frameworks

# Foreword
All ai's were tested using a free CohereAPI key. They didn't always give pretty results or use the correct tools, but the code worked and I'm proud of that.

# MainAi.py
This file is Imports from AiMemory and AITools and functions as the main product. I might add Application interfacing to this later

# AiMemory.py and AITools.py
These files are where the Memory and Tools aspects where tested and developed and after making the Main.py the interactive aspects of those files were turned to text and left in the files for perusal.

# AiMemoryAgentTest.py & VecterTest.py
These files were made to observe Vecter Memory and Agent Memory management in a vacumm. I uploaded them for perusal.

# About Me
Hello.
I am N. Zikalala a novice Software Dev with a Bsc IT Robotics.
I've spent the last month struggling through the DeepLearning ai course on CrewAi because the CrewAi framework was outdated and package management was such a headache. After deciding to try putting together myself without frameworks, last Sunday night, I made some real progress and am posting my terminal Ai agent today, Thursday. I'm very happy with my work and will improve it. Would aprieciate any and all feedback <3
